<div class="test" align="left">
<p align="left" >Indian cuisine consists of a variety of regional and traditional cuisines native to the Indian subcontinent. Given the diversity in soil, climate, culture, ethnic groups, and occupations, these cuisines vary substantially and use locally available spices, herbs, vegetables, and fruits. Indian food is also heavily influenced by religion, in particular Hinduism, cultural choices and traditions.
</p>

<p align="left">Cuisine differs across India's diverse regions as a result of variation in local culture, geographical location (proximity to sea, desert, or mountains), and economics. It also varies seasonally, depending on which fruits and vegetables are ripe.

</p>
<p align="left">Every region has their own specialties and different way of cooking. The style of cooking, flavor and their specialties change with the landscapes. Most of the Indian cuisines are vegetarian but the Indians also love non-vegetarian delicacies cooked out of fish, lamb, goat, chicken and other meats. Food has always been important to the culture of India.
